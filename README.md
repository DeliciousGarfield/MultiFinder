# MultiFinder
MultiFinder is an extension for Firefox and Chrome that supports multi-keyword search, which is more powerful than the built-in search function

## Firefox Demo
### A simple usecase on Wikipedia:

![firefox_demo](doc/images/firefox_demo.png)

### Also, you can add or remove search boxes as you like:

You can remove all search boxes like this:

![firefox_none](doc/images/firefox_none.png)

Or, you can keep only one search box like the built-in behavior:

![firefox_one](doc/images/firefox_one.png)

Or, you can add as many search boxes as you like:

With two search boxes:

![firefox_two](doc/images/firefox_two.png)

With three search boxes:

![firefox_three](doc/images/firefox_three.png)

With four search boxes:

![firefox_four](doc/images/firefox_four.png)

## Miscellaneous
You can download the Firefox version from [releases](https://github.com/DeliciousGarfield/MultiFinder/tree/master/release). Chrome version will soon be available.
